# Online Payment Fraud Detection using Machine Learning in Python
In this project, I will work with an existing dataset of online transactions, where the data includes features like transaction type, amount, sender and receiver account balances, and whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.

I will apply multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to build models that can accurately predict fraudulent transactions. We will first train the models and evaluate them based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

To assess the performance of the models, we will use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and compare the results to select the best-performing model for fraud detection.

Finally, I will implement the best-performing model to classify whether new transactions are fraudulent or legitimate, ensuring that the system can identify potential fraud with high precision and reliability.

# **OBJECTIVES**

The primary objective of this project is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict fraudulent transactions based on transaction data.

To explore various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, for fraud detection.

To evaluate the performance of the developed models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

To compare the performance of different machine learning models and select the best-performing algorithm for detecting fraudulent transactions.
